There are tree types of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc. they are
    called local variables.
Upside:
    Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write code
    with the help of local variables.
Downside:
    They can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created. They have very limited scope.
instance variables:
    All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables.
upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local variables.
downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.
static variables:
    All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables.
